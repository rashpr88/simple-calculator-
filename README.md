For one of my individual assignments, I developed a program that facilitates basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is designed to work with decimals and allows the use of parentheses to prioritize calculations.

Additionally, I implemented a user-friendly interface that offers both light and dark modes, providing users with the option to choose their preferred visual style. This enhances the overall user experience and accommodates personal preferences for interface aesthetics.

Overall, the program provides a convenient and efficient way to perform arithmetic calculations with support for decimals and parentheses, while also offering a visually pleasing interface with customizable themes.
